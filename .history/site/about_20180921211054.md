# About Jeremy

<img src="/images/mugshot.jpg" alt="Jeremy Collins" class="mugshot">

Hi, I'm Jeremy. I'm a Software Engineer at [Fanbank](fanbank.com), and previously I was at [Event Farm](eventfarm.com) and [Act-On](act-on.com). Professionally, I focus on developing attractive, fast, component-based progressive webapps.

# Recent Work
* [Codable](http://appstore.com/codable)
    * Front-end web developer tools, but in an iOS app (iPhone only for now). Allows resizing of the browser view, JavaScript console access, as well as browsing and modifying the DOM of the current page.
* [Event Farm Core Platform](https://eventfarm.com)
    * I'm one of the primary authors of the Event Farm Core platform web application, which is built upon Angular (v2+), webpack, typescript, RxJS and NgRX Store. Event Farm is a paid service however 
* [RoomCast](http://roomcast.teleadapt.com)
    * A one-pager (with modals) product site, built with AngularJS components for the interactive and animated elements, and optimized for quick performance. Built with webpack.
* Plus what you may find on [my Github account](https://github.com/jdodsoncollins)

# About this page

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and hosted on a Digital Ocean Ubuntu droplet. 

I realize I could have this site hosted for free on GitHub Pages, but using my Digital Ocean server is also a fun resource to have (for example, I also have it manage MX, dkim and SPF records to forward @jeremycollins.net email around via [MailGun](https://mailgun.com))

I've shipped my first major-ish update to [Codable](http://appstore.com/codable) -- now at 1.1.X

Improvements:
- Minor UI cleanup with header texts looking cleaner, and support for dynamic type where appropriate
- Added "home" button on browser to more easily return back to your default page
- Updated the available list of viewport device-size presets in settings
- Improved the CSS editing view

Codable I feel is a good app, albeit utilitarian. Despite me basically never promoting it outside my own website, it has thousands of users, and I hope its been a help to those trying to do some debugging / QA on small screens.

# About Jeremy

Hi, I'm Jeremy. I'm a Software Engineer at [Event Farm](eventfarm.com), and previously I was at [Act-On](act-on.com). Professionally, I focus on developing attractive, fast, component-based progressive webapps. I also tinker with native mobile app development, and the blending in between (such as [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)). I've been doing this a few years now, after teaching myself web development. Previous to this, I worked technical support and wrote domuentation, and it was my undergrad years at college before that. 

Outside of my time spent in front of computers, I'm a history and politics buff. Local community organizations are important for every region, and I try to contribute to some of the ones around me, often as a volunteer developer / web admin. My wife and I are also dedicated cat guarians.

# Recent Completed Work
* [Event Farm Homepage](eventfarm.com)
    * The official company website, built as a static HTML site with Angular JS. CakePHP back-end. My goal was to make it load fast without having to sacrifice graphical richness, and it rates highly on most performance and bandwidth usage benchmarks.
* [ADEMS](adems2017.vote)
    * I volunteered myself to create a landing page able to take in an address and return voter district data. This leverages the Google Geolocation API and the [OpenStates](https://openstates.org) API
* Plus what you may find on [my Github account](https://github.com/jdodsoncollins)

# About this page

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and hosted on a Digital Ocean Ubuntu droplet. 

I realize I could have this site hosted for free on GitHub Pages, but using my Digital Ocean server is also a fun resource to have (for example, I also have it manage MX, dkim and SPF records to forward @jeremycollins.net email around via [MailGun](https://mailgun.com))

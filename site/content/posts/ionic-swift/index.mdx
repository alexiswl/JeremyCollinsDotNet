 As a quickie demo, I've added this project to by GitHub -- [Ionic and Swift Hybrid Demo iOS Xcode Project](https://github.com/jdodsoncollins/ionic-swift-navigation) 

I've published this becuase it is a concise demo of the following scenario:
- You have an iOS app written in Swift
- You want to specify *one view* in the otherwise vanilla Swift + Xcode storyboard app to be controlled by an Ionic TypeScript + Angular app
- You want to be able to freely navigate between the swift view(s) and the [Ionic v4](https://ionicframework.com/docs)-based view (becuse of couse you'd want navigation to work within the app and appear seamless)

I couldn't find any existing guides covering this particular scenario but its a pretty compelling use-case for teams wanting to create mobile apps that leverage a hybrid webview in an existing native codebase.

It uses [Ionic Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com) to leverage some `UINavigation` native API hooks to be called within the Ionic Angular App

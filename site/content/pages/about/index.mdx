Oh, hello there. This is my personal portfolio website, though it is rarely updated and mostly serves as the public front-end for various things this server runs.

If you'd like to contact me or find me elsewhere, I have email and so on listed on the [Homepage](/)

### Recent Full-Time Work
* [HitRecord Web](https://www.hitrecord.org)
    * HitRecord as a service is a collaboration tool for users, focused on positivity and being a welcoming network. Behind the curtain, it is an Angular web front-end and native mobile clients powered by a Rails API. The web and mobile clients are new, clean, and we take pride in making them as good as they can be.
* [Fanbank API, Consumer, and Business Portal](https://www.fanbank.com)
    * Fanbank is a e-commerce and marketing product powered by Node, React SPAs, and server-side React. We were a small team and each responsible for all product engineering aspects (server, API, client, testing, UI).
* [Event Farm](https://www.eventfarm.com)
    * EventFarm is an experiential event management platform. I was focused on the front-end Angular and React products, developed an iOS app, and got to work with many great team members during my many years there.

### About this page

This site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and hosted on a Digital Ocean Ubuntu droplet. Want to see the source for the page? See [My Public Github Project for it](https://github.com/jdodsoncollins/JeremyCollinsDotNet)

As far as UI goes, this site implements and extends the theme [Minimal Blog by LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog), with the following customizations:
- Overridden primary components (header, footer, homepage, post)
- A few added utility components (such as a graphql optimized image-loader component and root wrapper)
- New hooks and texts
- [Theme UI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/theme-ui/) overrides (most notably, the site should automatically toggle light or dark mode depending on your device settings, if applicable)

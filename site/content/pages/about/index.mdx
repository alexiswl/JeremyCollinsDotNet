Oh, hello there. This is my personal portfolio website, though it is rarely updated and mostly serves as the public front-end for various things this server runs.

#### Recent Work
* [HitRecord Web](https://www.hitrecord.org)
    * HitRecord as a service is a collaboration tool for users, focused on positivity and being a welcoming network. Behind the curtain, it is an Angular web front-end and native mobile clients powered by a Rails API. The web and mobile clients are new, clean, and we take pride in making them as good as they can be.
* [Fanbank API, Consumer, and Business Portal](https://www.fanbank.com)
    * During my stint as a west-side LA resident, I served as a full-stack developer for the Fanbank platform. Fanbank is a e-commerce and marketing product powered by Node, React SPAs, and server-side React. 
* [Codable](http://appstore.com/codable)
    * Front-end web developer tools, but in an iOS app (iPhone only for now). Allows resizing of the browser view, JavaScript console access, as well as browsing and modifying the DOM of the current page.
* Plus what you may find on [my Github account](https://github.com/jdodsoncollins)

As far as UI goes, this site implements and extends the theme [Minimal Blog by LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog), with the following customizations:
- Overridden primary components (header, footer, homepage, post)
- A few added utility components (such as a graphql optimized image-loader component and root wrapper)
- New hooks and texts
- [Theme UI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/theme-ui/) overrides (most notably, the site should automatically toggle light or dark mode depending on your device settings, if applicable)

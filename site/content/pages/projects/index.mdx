#### Codable

###### Platform: iOS (iPhone only)

Codable for iPhone provides these primary features:
- resizable viewport with scaling, allowing you to view any URL as if you were on a smaller **or** larger iOS screen size
- JavaScript console support (including catching logs from page as well as entering JS to evaluate)
- Rendered DOM node navigation, with HTML/CSS manipulation in a pane once you find the DOM node level you wish to edit

There's also the ability to view the page's pre-rendered source, as well as a few other settings. Codable supports all iPhone screen sizes, including landscape mode to allow a little more width flexibility when resizing the webview.

Codable heavily uses the [WKWebView.evaluateJavaScipt()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/1415017-evaluatejavascript) API to get and set browser console or DOM/source data. The codebase is in Swift, with minimal leverage of third party libraries.

The desire for this app came about from me getting work-related messages about front-end issues that I could not debug while away from a computer. In these cases all I wanted was a basic subset of desktop browser developer tools available on my iPhone, such as the console or node list. There are plenty of iOS tools to view a webpage's source, but very few let you browse the **rendered** source or adjust the viewport size.

- [📩 Email](email-added-here-async-to-discourage-scraping) -- I do actually check email.
- [🐙 GitHub](https://github.com/jdodsoncollins) -- Though please bear in mind most work of mine is closed-source.
- [🐦 Twitter](https://twitter.com/jollins) -- I rarely tweet but use my long follow list as a news/commentary feed, as well as a surprisingly good developer learning resource.
- [🏢 LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-collins-37807911/) -- Kept up to date; consider this my online resume.
- [📚 Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25277306-jeremy) -- I read (or listen to audiobooks) a lot. When I'm on a long solo walk or drive, there is almost always an audiobook playing.
